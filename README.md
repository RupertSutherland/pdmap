Thin sheet permanent deformation map with faults (Haines and Sutherland)

Codes to accompany the paper by Haines and Sutherland (2018), Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth

The fortran codes are currently manually compiled and then run, with some python too, from a linux script. Gmsh is also used.
A python interface, tools to streamline the workflow, and better documentation are currently under development
